In my opinion (who else could be writing this?), art is not much different from engineering in terms of the creation process. The fineness of both types of works, is proportional to the granularity of my thoughts. That is some what equivalent to how well Ive done observing and summarizing facts and applying my own unique perspective on them. When it comes to "intention", however, engineering is much less tolerable than art. You can create an artwork without much deliberation(just like how I did my shitty paintings without any techniques), but engineering demands rationality in every step of the design process, without which it would tragically fail at unexpected times.
