    Here is a brief of this project:
    We used feature tracking to locate 4 corners of the computer screen. It is implemented by looping through all the pixels
    in each frame and find the smallest SSD value. It took around 1 hour to locate the trackers of all frames at first,
    but we improved the algorithm by only searching the surrounding area of each tracker in the previous frame. In this way the running time is 
    shortened to 2 minutes, which is 30 times faster. After that, for each frame we calculated the perspective transformation matrix
    between the screen and the replacement image using SVD. Then in each frame we applied the matrices to map all the pixels from the content 
    image to the screen, so that the screen replacement is invariant to perspective change from frame to frame.
    Thanks for watching and special thanks to my partner @Hien for making this project possible!
